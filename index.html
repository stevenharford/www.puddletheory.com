        <h1>Puddle theory</h1>

<blockquote>
    <p>
        imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, &lsquo;This is an
        interesting world I find myself in &ndash; an interesting hole I find
        myself in &ndash; fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me
        staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!&rsquo; This is
        such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats
        up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still
        frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all
        right, because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have
        him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I
        think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.
